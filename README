Installing mpdscribble
----------------------

See the INSTALL file.


Rating / Love
-------------

With MPD 0.17 or later, clients can submit track ratings over the
client-to-client protocol.  To do that, the client sends the following
command to mpd:

 sendmessage mpdscribble love

The song that is currently playing will be rated with the "love"
attribute, as soon as it gets submitted to the scrobbler.
